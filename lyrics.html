                <h4>
                We're talking away
                I don't know what I'm to say
                I'll say it anyway
                Today is another day to find you

                Shying away
                I'll be coming for your love, okay?

                Take on me (take on me)
                Take me on (take on me)
                I'll be gone
                In a day or two

                So needless to say
                I'm odds and ends
                But I'll be stumbling away
                Slowly learning that life is okay

                Say after me
                It's no better to be safe than sorry

                Take on me (take on me)
                Take me on (take on me)
                I'll be gone
                In a day or two

                All the things that you say, yeah
                Is it life or just to play my worries away?
                You're all the things I've got to remember

                You're shying away
                I'll be coming for you anyway

                Take on me (take on me)
                Take me on (take on me)
                I'll be gone in a day
                Take on me (take on me)
                Take me on (take on me)

                I'll be gone (take on me, take on me)
                In a day (take me on, take on me)

                Take on me (take on me)
                Take me on (take on me)
